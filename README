pyUmlaut0r
==========

This is a very small program that is handy you if you're using a us-keyboard
layout but need to use german umlaute every once in a while.

You can start a daemon (on system/session startup) and it creates a system tray
icon that you can right-click to get a menu that contains the german umlaute.
If you select one it will be copied to your clipboard.

If the daemon is running you can call the pyUmlaut0r script again (for example
with a keyboard shortcut) and the same menu will popup next to your cursor and
lets you easily select an umlaut with the keyboard.

running pyUmlaut0r
------------------

start the daemon:

  ./pyUmlaut0r.py

call the "dbus client menu":
  ./pyUmlautor.py -d
